Script:

Scene 1: Entrance to train station.

"You've spent your whole life dreaming of becoming a lightning wielding sorcereress, but unfortunately you had to grow up and instead took a job recruiting young muggles for some giant corporation. On your way home you heard some kids talking about a secret train that takes you to the Jack Daniel's school for Thunder Magicks! You've followed them to the train station, find that secret train!"

  Mysterious Figure: "Hello pretty lady, I know what brings you here! You'll find it at Platform 7 and half!"

Scene 1a: Inside train on a seat

You've made it on the secret train. You're so excited! Infinite powers are soon to be yours! Lets enjoy the ride! (slideshow of real life pics in window of train)

Scene 2: Forest outside Jack Daniels school of Thunder Magicks

"It's been a year since you began your journey with magic! You're sick because you're a half muggle and you're dainty. The headmaster suggested you go visit the Magic Forest nearby and grab a feather off the magical Casparian Hound. It's feather can be used in a potion that will increase your magical powers! Find the Casparian Hound in the forest and get its feather!"

  Mysterious Figure: Immobilizes Casparian Hound so feather can be collected, "Take it and go! It cannot hurt me I have no heart!

<Collect feather and return to Jack Daniels> "Great job! Once you take this potion you're power will increase 10 fold!"

Scene 3: On a bridge in front of the Jack Daniels school of Thunder Magicks

"It's been 3 years, since you snuck into the school and learned how to become an Electric Sorcereress! The headmaster entrusts you with a dangerous task! Zombies have been resurrected by an evil mage Dark Shelby and threaten your school! Fend them off at all costs!"

  Mysterious Figure: "It's dangerous to go alone, take this!" <Give gun/bullets> 
  
<After zombies defeated, Dark Shelby appears> "Dark Shelby has arrived she's attempting to kill you with her shade magic! Defend yourself!" <Player attempts to shoot down incoming shade magic, eventually loses> 

  Mysterious Figure: "We must combine our powers if we are to take down Dark Shelby! Take my hand if you want to live!"
  
<Fire Jagerbomb spell at Dark Shelby>
  
  Mysterious Figure: "We did it! I have something to admit, I haven't been stalking you because I'm creepy, but because I've fallen for you. You're electrifying purple hair has me completely enthralled! <Explosive reveal> Join me and together we shall rule the galaxy!"
